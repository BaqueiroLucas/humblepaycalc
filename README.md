# humblepaycalc
A humble pay rate calculator according to Brazilian labour law. I first learned how to do it at PY4E, a specialization on how to begin to program in Python taught for Prof. Dr. Chuck Severance, somebody who does not know me, but of whom I am so much in debt for teaching me through his fabulous project.

It is quite modified, as I challenge myself to refine my coding skills by adding the following Brazilian law conventions:
- at sundays and holidays, the pay rate is doubled;
- the so called "on call hours" ("sobreaviso", in Portuguese), that is when somebody can be called during this period to work, is fixed on 1/3 of the pay rate.

That is all. Enjoy and make good use of it, if you eventually come here!
